# Blood Bank Management System
The purpose of the Blood Bank Management System is to make the procedure easy for finding blood for those in need, through software application rather than physically searching for blood in the city, manually through blood banks.

Blood Bank Management System aims to store the information of all the different blood groups in the blood bank and information about the blood donors along with their details. The user can search the availability of a particular blood group in a blood bank and can request for it or can also donate his blood to the blood bank for others help. 

 This was a 5th sem DBMS course project. The main objective of this project was  
 * To use DDL effectively to create the back end for storing the information.
 * To write the SQL queries to store and retrieve the information.

Programming Language : **Java ( GUI - Java Swings)**  
Database : **MySQL (XAMPP)**
